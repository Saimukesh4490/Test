Test Project
This repository contains the code for the Test Project. Below are the setup instructions and information about the CI/CD pipeline integrated via GitHub Actions.

CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
Overview
We use GitHub Actions to automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code. This pipeline ensures that every change made to the repository goes through a series of checks before being deployed to production.

Benefits of GitHub Actions:
Easy Setup: No need for dedicated servers or complex configurations. Everything works directly within GitHub.

Customizable Workflows: Choose pre-built workflows from the GitHub Marketplace or create your own.

Supports Multiple Platforms: Platform agnostic, works with any programming language, and can deploy to any cloud.

Workflow Steps:
Create or Choose a Repository: We have set up this repository to automatically run GitHub Actions when code is pushed or when a pull request is created.

GitHub Actions in Action:

Pull requests trigger workflows that install dependencies, run tests, and ensure the code meets quality standards.

After merging the pull request, another workflow builds and deploys the updated code to the production environment.

Changes in Code: Any updates or fixes you make to the codebase (e.g., adding features or bug fixes) will trigger this CI/CD pipeline.

How to Trigger CI/CD Pipeline:
Make changes to the code.

Push the changes to the repository.

Watch the GitHub Actions workflow run automatically.

Workflow Visualizer:
GitHub Actions provides a workflow visualizer, where you can view the status of each step in the pipeline. It gives clear indicators (green for success, yellow for in-progress, and red for failure) to track the progress of each job.

Live Logs:
Live logs are available for debugging and tracking what happens at each step of the pipeline. You can access detailed logs directly through the Actions tab on the GitHub repository.
